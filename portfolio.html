                <p>The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a structured decision-making method used to analyze complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable parts. 
                    It involves decomposing a problem into a hierarchy of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives, allowing decision-makers to evaluate options based on their relative importance.
                    AHP involves pairwise comparisons of these criteria and alternatives, which are then used to generate a weighted score, helping prioritize decisions. It's widely applied in various
                    fields, including business, engineering, environmental management, and policy making, as it provides a comprehensive, quantifiable way to tackle multi-criteria decision problems.

                <p>Kathmandu Valley, the capital region of Nepal, faces severe air pollution, primarily due to rapid urbanization, vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction. The city's geographical location, surrounded by mountains, exacerbates the problem by trapping pollutants, especially during the winter months. High concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) have significant health impacts, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and even premature death. The government has introduced several measures, such as promoting cleaner fuels and public transport, but effective long-term solutions remain a challenge due to the increasing urban population and inadequate enforcement of environmental regulations.

                <p>n June 2022, the Melamchi Valley, located in the Sindhupalchok district of Nepal, was devastated by catastrophic flooding. Heavy rainfall caused the Melamchi River to overflow, inundating surrounding areas, destroying homes, infrastructure, and agricultural land. The flood resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of communities, and disruption to daily activities. The disaster highlighted the vulnerability of many areas in Nepal to flash floods, particularly due to deforestation, climate change, and poor river management. Despite efforts for recovery, rebuilding the region and restoring livelihoods remains a long-term challenge.

                <h3>Fire Incident Map - April 2022</h3>
                <p>In 2022, Nepal experienced a significant number of forest fires, particularly during the dry season, which caused extensive damage to both the environment and local communities. The fires mainly affected the mid-hills and the Terai regions, areas prone to seasonal fires due to high temperatures, dry vegetation, and human activities like slash-and-burn farming.

                    The forest fires of 2022 were exacerbated by the country's changing climate, which has led to longer dry spells and higher temperatures, making forests more susceptible to ignition. Strong winds during the fire season further fueled the flames, causing the fires to spread rapidly.
                    
                    These fires not only destroyed thousands of hectares of valuable forest land but also posed serious health risks to the population, especially in urban areas where smoke and particulate matter from the fires worsened air quality. Additionally, wildlife habitats were severely impacted, and the fires destroyed precious biodiversity.
                    
                    The government and various non-governmental organizations launched efforts to control the fires, including deploying fire brigades and local volunteers. However, the challenges of preventing forest fires in a country with a high dependency on agriculture and a lack of fire management infrastructure remained prominent. The 2022 forest fires highlighted the urgent need for sustainable land management practices and better fire prevention strategies.TThis portfolio showcases the fire incidents recorded in April 2022.
