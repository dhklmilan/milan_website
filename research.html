            <h2>Forest Fire Risk Mapping in Chure Terai Madhesh Landscape</h2>
            <p>The Chure Terai Madhesh Landscape (CTML) in Nepal faces severe forest fire risks due to its unique ecological and climatic conditions. This study employs a combination of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) to map fire-prone areas. The analysis considers factors such as topography, climatic variables, and human activities, including proximity to settlements and roads. Results highlight the significant role of anthropogenic factors in driving forest fire risks, amplified by climatic variables like rising temperatures and decreased precipitation. The research provides a risk zonation map, aiding policymakers in prioritizing high-risk zones for fire management. Utilizing satellite data and GIS tools, the study addresses data collection challenges and offers a scalable framework for other fire-prone regions. The findings emphasize community-based initiatives, regulatory land-use policies, and early warning systems as critical strategies for mitigating fire risks and preserving CTML's biodiversity.</p>

            <h3>Species Distribution of Seven Woody Bamboo Species in Nepal</h3>
            <p>This study examines the distribution of seven woody bamboo species in Nepal, analyzing ecological preferences and threats to their habitats. Using field surveys and species distribution modeling, the research identifies critical factors like elevation, soil type, and precipitation as determinants of bamboo distribution. Results reveal that some species, such as Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, prefer lowland areas with high rainfall, while others, like Arundinaria aristata, thrive in high-altitude regions. However, human activities, including deforestation and over-harvesting, have significantly impacted bamboo habitats, reducing their ecological roles. The study emphasizes bambooâ€™s importance in soil stabilization, carbon sequestration, and local livelihoods. By mapping suitable habitats, it provides a foundation for sustainable management and conservation efforts. Promoting community involvement in bamboo conservation ensures sustainable use while supporting economic benefits for local populations.</p>

            <h3>Forest Fire Risk Mapping in Rasuwa District insight from earth observation and AHP</h3>
            <p> Rasuwa District, located in Nepal's central Himalayan region, is highly vulnerable to forest fires due to its rugged terrain, dense vegetation, and climatic variability. This research uses remote sensing and GIS to identify fire-prone areas, considering factors such as elevation, slope, land cover, and precipitation. Anthropogenic activities, including proximity to roads and settlements, significantly contribute to fire risks. The findings reveal that lower-altitude areas with high human activity are most susceptible, particularly during dry seasons with prolonged low rainfall. The study highlights the need for early warning systems, community awareness, and sustainable land-use practices to mitigate fire risks. By providing a detailed fire risk map, the research aids policymakers in prioritizing high-risk zones and allocating resources effectively, contributing to forest conservation and community safety.</p>
